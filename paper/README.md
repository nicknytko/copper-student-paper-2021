# How to Use this Template

The file `paper-template.tex` should be used as a template for a student paper submission.  The first step is to rename this file to
```bash
cp paper-template.tex LASTNAME_FIRSTNAME_paper.tex
```

The template is based on the latest SIAM article class, which is detailed here: [https://www.siam.org/Publications/Journals/About-SIAM-Journals/Information-for-Authors](https://www.siam.org/Publications/Journals/About-SIAM-Journals/Information-for-Authors).  The paper should conform to the SIAM documentclass as outlined here: [https://www.siam.org/Portals/0/Macros/Standard/docsiamart.pdf](https://www.siam.org/Portals/0/Macros/Standard/docsiamart.pdf).

```bash
wget https://www.siam.org/Portals/0/Macros/Standard/siamart171218.cls
